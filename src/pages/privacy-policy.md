# Privacy Policy

- We **collect as little data as possible**. **None, by default!** Not cookies, not email, no web analytics tracking, nothing. Just start using the app. If you want to access your data outside of the browser you start off in, you've got a couple options:

  - Export the data yourself and re-import it from another device. This is as clunky as it sounds, but it keeps your data completely private. It will never be sent to any server/service.
  - Sync your data with our Google Sheets integration. We'll use as little data from Google as we can. We'll make an Entire.Life folder and create a spreadsheet for each Entire.Life chart/ledger you make. We'll only touch stuff in that folder.

- **We don't sell anything**. We have no business model. Entire.Life costs us nothing to keep aliveâ€”the frontend is deployed for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and the data lives in Google Sheets. As long as these or similar services stay free, Entire.Life stays around forever without needing to sell your data or charge you anything.

- If you choose to, **exposing your data will be really obvious**. Examples:

  - You can choose to collaborate with other Entire.Life users who sync their data with Google Sheets. They'll see the Entire.Life charts you share with them. They'll see them both in Entire.Life and in their Google Drive.
  - We (plan to) offer a way to export a static version of one of your Entire.Life charts, which you could embed as HTML in another site, such as a blog.

  If you don't do one of these obvious actions, all of your data will stay private.
